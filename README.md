# Java Programming Notes

## What is Java?
- Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems.
- It is platform-independent, allowing Java programs to run on any device with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Known for its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.

## Writing the First Java Program
1. A Java program begins with a `public class` declaration.
2. The filename must match the class name.
3. The `main` method is the entry point for the program.
4. Statements are enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

## Typical Structure of a Java Program
- **Package Declaration:** (optional) Organizes classes into namespaces.
- **Import Statements:** (optional) Bring in classes from other packages.
- **Class Declaration:** The main structure, contains fields, methods, etc.
- **Main Method:** The entry point of execution.

## What is a Variable?
- A variable is a container for storing data values.
- Variables must be declared with a data type before use.
- Java has various data types like `int`, `double`, `String`, etc.

## Data Types in Java
1. **Primitive Data Types:** int, double, char, boolean, etc.
2. **Reference Data Types:** Objects, arrays, etc.

## Operators in Java
- **Arithmetic Operators:** +, -, *, /, %
- **Relational Operators:** <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
- **Logical Operators:** &&, ||, !
- **Assignment Operators:** =, +=, -=, *=, /=

## Java Classes and Objects
- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object:** An instance of a class.
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on the data.
- **Inheritance:** A mechanism for creating a new class using properties of an existing class.
- **Polymorphism:** The ability of a method to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

## What is OOP?
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures.
- Emphasizes concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Features of OOP – Core Features
1. **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods into a single unit (class).
2. **Inheritance:** Acquiring properties and behaviors from an existing class.
3. **Polymorphism:** A single entity representing different forms.

## Features of OOP – Other Features
1. **Abstraction:** Simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on real-world entities.
2. **Association:** Relationships between classes, like one-to-one or one-to-many.
3. **Aggregation:** A special form of association, representing "whole-part" relationships.

## Introduction to Decision Control
- Decision control structures determine the flow of a program based on certain conditions.
- **if Statement:** Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
- **if-else Statement:** Executes one block of code if the condition is true, another if false.
- **Nested if Statement:** if statements inside another if statement.

## Switch Statement and Ternary Operator
- **Switch Statement:** A concise way to handle multiple conditions based on the value of an expression.
- **Ternary Operator (?):** A shorthand way to write an if-else statement in a single line.

## Java Identifiers
- An identifier is a name given to entities like classes, methods, variables, etc.
- Rules: Must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. Subsequent characters can also be digits.
- Examples: `myVariable`, `calculateTotal`, `Employee_salary`.
